# Beat Mix

## Project Overview

An application that can loop over a 16-step grid of four drum types and play them when they are activated. It has functionality to invert each row of drums, clear each row of drums, or clear the entire board. It can also retrieve and save presets to a server.

## How To Begin

Once you have the project downloaded, you'll need to run some terminal commands to get the application started. First, open the root project directory in your terminal. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies of this project. Once it has finished installing, you can run `npm run start` to begin your server. You'll see `Server listening on port 4001` in the terminal. 

To see the application in its working state, simply open **index.html** in a web browser. You should use [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html) (at least version 60) or [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) (at least version 55). If your version of Chrome or Firefox is too old, correctly-written code may still not run as expected. The links above will let you download the latest release of either browser if you do not have it or are unsure of which version you're running.
